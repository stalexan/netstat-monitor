# Netstat-monitor -- Monitor network connections on your system

## Description

Netstat-monitor is a command line tool for monitoring network connections. Its output is similar to the output from the netstat command with the options "netstat --inet -alp". Netstat-monitor can be left running, though, and will report new connections as they are made. Also, filters can be used to limit what's displayed to just what's unexpected or interesting.

## Installation

Netstat-monitor has been tested on Debian based distros based on the Linux 3.2 kernel; 
specifically: Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian 7.0 (Wheezy). It may work on other distros, if the
format of the /proc filespace is the same. But, this hasn't been tested.

To get the latest version:

    $ rm -rf /tmp/stalexan-netstat-monitor-*
    $ wget -O /tmp/netstat-monitor-last.tgz https://github.com/stalexan/netstat-monitor/tarball/master

Extract files:

    $ cd /tmp
    $ tar zxvf netstat-monitor-last.tgz
    $ cd stalexan-netstat-monitor-*

Install, on a Debian or Ubuntu machine:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-netaddr
    $ sudo python3 setup.py install

This will install the netstat-monitor exe to /usr/local/bin/ and the netstat.py module to /usr/local/lib/python3.2/dist-packages/.

Another option, instead of doing an install, is to just run netstat-monitor directly from where the files were extracted.

Also, tarballs are available here: https://www.alexan.org/netstat-monitor

## Running

To run:

    netstat-monitor

Here's some sample output:

## Filters

Filters can be used to limit what's displayed to just unexpected or interesting connections. A typical use case is to run netstat-monitor without any filters at first, and then add filters over time until only interesting connections are displayed.

Filters are created in config files that are listed on the command line. For example:

    netstat-monitor sample-filters

The file [sample-filters](https://github.com/stalexan/netstat-monitor/blob/master/sample-filters) is provided with the install, and has some example filters. A few of them are:

    [ntpupdate]
    exe: /usr/sbin/ntpdate
    user: root

    [firefox]
    exe: /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
    user: alice 
    remote_ports: 53, 80, 443, 8080

    [upstart]
    exe: /sbin/upstart-udev-bridge
    user: root
    states = FIN_WAIT1, FIN_WAIT2, TIME_WAIT, CLOSE, CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK, CLOSING

    [ignore-lan]
    remote_ips: 192.168.1.0/24  

Each section defines a new filter. A section starts with the filter name, enclosed in square brackets. The name can be any alphanumeric string. Each line after that defines a filter parameter. For example, the first section defines a filter called ntpupdate that has two parameters: exe and user. This filter will look for connections with exe set to /usr/sbin/ntpupdate and user set to root. Any connections with these settings will be filtered out, and not displayed.

The available filter parameters are:

* exe: The executable for the process that opened the connection.
* cmdline: The command line of the process that opened the connection.
* cmdline_is_re: Whether cmd_line is a regular expression (true/false). Default is false.
* pid: The pid of the process that opened the connection.
* user: The user for the process that opened the connection.
* local_hosts: Comma separated list of local hosts.
* local_ports: Comma separated list of local ports.
* remote_hosts: Comma separated list of remote hosts, specified with domain names. 
* remote_ips: Comma separated list of IP address ranges, in CIDR notation.
* remote_ports: Comma separated list of remote ports.
* states: Comma separated list of Connection states.

There's a command line parameter that acts as a kind of filter as well: --ignore-loopback. 
It will cause any connections on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) to be filtered out. 
By default it's false.
